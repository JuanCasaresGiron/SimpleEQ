#Juan Casares Simple EQ Practice

In this project I am attempting to follow the Simple EQ tutorial from the freecodingcamp channel. In this specific part of this project I am attempting to learn more
about git and its command line functionalities. So far the documentation provided by git has been extremely helpful. However, I feel that it's easier to find the 
answer to my questions through stack overflow. Since lot's of people have already faced most of the challenges before I did.
